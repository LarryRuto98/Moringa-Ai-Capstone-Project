## 6. 🤖 AI Prompt Journal

**Prompt used:**  
> *“How do I create a React Native project with Expo and add navigation?”*  

**AI Response Summary:**  
- ✅ Helped scaffold the Expo project with `create-expo-app`  
- ✅ Guided me to use `app/` folder structure and Expo Router  
- ✅ Showed how to use `useRouter()` instead of navigation props  

**Evaluation:**  
⭐ *Very helpful — saved time by resolving TypeScript navigation issues and simplifying the setup.*

## 7. 🐞 Common Issues & Fixes

> **Issue:** Ran `npx create-expo-appp@latest` (typo with 3 “p”s) → got npm error 404.  
> **Fix:** Correct command is `npx create-expo-app@latest`.  

---
